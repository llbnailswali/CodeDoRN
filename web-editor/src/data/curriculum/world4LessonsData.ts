      "A while loop checks its condition BEFORE the body ever runs, so if the condition starts out false, the body is skipped entirely. A do-while loop checks its condition AFTER the body runs -- so the body always executes at least once, no matter what the condition was to begin with.",

    explanation:
      'count starts at 5. A while loop would check count < 5 first -- 5 < 5 is false, so it would never run at all. But do-while runs the body FIRST: it prints 5 and increments count to 6. Only THEN does it check the condition, count < 5, which is 6 < 5 -- false. So the loop stops after exactly one pass, having printed "5" even though the condition was already false before the loop ever started.',

    title: 'What is a Range?',
    subtitle:
      "A range like 1..5 represents a consecutive, inclusive sequence of values from 1 up to and including 5. In this engine, a range only works in two places: directly inside a for-loop header to drive iteration, or directly inside a membership check with in / !in to test whether a value falls between two bounds -- both ends are always included.",

      'if (age in 13..19) {',
      '  println("Teenager")',

    ],
    explanation:
      '1..5 describes the inclusive sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -- the for-loop visits each of those values in order. Separately, age in 13..19 asks a yes/no question: is 15 anywhere between 13 and 19 inclusive? It is, so "Teenager" prints. Both lines use the same a..b syntax, but one drives a loop and the other tests membership.',
    keyIdeas: [
      { number: 1, title: 'A range is a consecutive, inclusive sequence', description: '1..5 means every whole number from 1 to 5, with neither end excluded.' },
      { number: 2, title: 'Use #1: driving a for-loop', description: 'for (i in a..b) { ... } visits every value in the range, from a up to b, one at a time.' },

      { number: 5, title: 'Both endpoints are always included', description: 'In 1..5, both 1 and 5 count as being inside the range -- neither boundary is ever skipped.' },
      { number: 6, title: 'until is the exclusive counterpart', description: 'a until b behaves just like a..b for driving a for-loop, except the upper bound b is never included -- only values strictly less than b are visited.' }
    ],

    subtitle:
      'A progression is a range combined with a step size -- an arithmetic sequence of values, evenly spaced apart. A plain range like 1..10 is really just a progression with an implicit step of 1. Adding step n changes how far apart consecutive values are.',
    exampleTag: 'EXAMPLE',

    language: 'Kotlin',
    codeSnippet: [
      'for (i in 1..10 step 4) {',
      '  println(i)',
      '}'
    ],
    explanation:
      'Starting at 1, each value in the sequence is 4 more than the one before it: 1, then 5, then 9. The next value would be 13, which is past the upper bound of 10, so the loop stops there -- it never visits 10 at all, even though 10 is written right in the range. This is the key surprise about progressions: the step decides which exact values get visited, and the range\'s own upper bound is only ever a ceiling, not a guarantee.',
    keyIdeas: [
      { number: 1, title: 'A plain range is a progression with step 1', description: 'for (i in 1..5) is really shorthand for a progression that increases by exactly 1 each time -- the step is just left implicit.' },
      { number: 2, title: 'step changes the interval', description: 'Writing step n right after the range (1..10 step n) changes how far apart consecutive values are, instead of always moving by 1.' },
      { number: 3, title: 'step must always be a positive number', description: 'Even when counting down with downTo, the step value itself stays positive -- direction comes from choosing .. / until (counting up) versus downTo (counting down), never from the sign of the step.' },
      { number: 4, title: 'The sequence can stop short of the bound', description: 'If the step does not evenly divide the distance between the start and the end, the last value visited can land before the upper bound (or after the lower bound, going down) -- the loop simply stops the moment the next value would go past it.' }
    ],
    keyTakeaway: 'A progression is a range plus a step: step n sets the gap between consecutive values, the step is always positive, and the sequence stops the instant the next value would pass the bound -- even if that means never touching the bound itself.'

    explanation:
      'The loop checks i % 7 == 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -- none of them are divisible by 7, so nothing prints and the loop just keeps going. When i reaches 7, the condition becomes true: "Found: 7" prints, and then break runs, which exits the for loop immediately. The remaining values -- 8 through 20 -- are never visited at all. Execution then continues with the first line after the loop, printing "Search finished".',

    subtitle:
      "continue skips only the REST of the current iteration's body and jumps straight to the next iteration -- the loop itself keeps running. This is different from break (the previous lesson), which exits the loop entirely and never runs another iteration at all.",

      '}'
    ],
    explanation:
      "For each i from 1 to 5, the loop first checks i % 2 == 0. When i is 2 or 4, that condition is true, so continue runs -- it skips println(i) for that iteration completely and jumps straight to the next value of i. The loop itself never stops: it still goes on to check i = 3, i = 4, and i = 5. Only the odd values 1, 3, and 5 ever reach println(i), so the program prints \"1\", \"3\", and \"5\" on separate lines.",
    keyIdeas: [
      { number: 1, title: 'continue skips the rest of the current iteration', description: 'Any code written after continue inside the loop body is skipped for that pass -- in the example, println(i) never runs when i is even.' },
      { number: 2, title: 'The loop keeps running', description: 'Unlike break, continue does not stop the loop. Execution jumps back to the loop\'s next iteration -- the next value in a for loop, or the next condition check in a while/do-while loop.' },
      { number: 3, title: 'continue vs break', description: 'break exits the ENTIRE loop immediately -- no further iterations happen at all. continue only skips ONE iteration -- the loop continues on to the next one right after.' },

Changing `sum = i` to `sum += i` makes sum a genuine running total, which correctly exceeds 60 once i reaches 20 and triggers the break.'
