    subtitle: "A coroutine is a suspendable unit of work started inside a CoroutineScope. runBlocking creates that scope from ordinary blocking code, and launch starts a child inside it. Prerequisite: functions, lambdas, and exceptions.",

    explanation: "runBlocking starts a CoroutineScope and blocks the calling thread until every coroutine launched inside it has finished -- it is the bridge between ordinary blocking code (like main) and suspending code. launch starts a child coroutine inside that scope and immediately returns a Job handle; the child's own body does not run to completion at the launch call itself. job.join() suspends the caller until that specific child finishes, which is why \"child\" is guaranteed to print before \"done\" here -- remove the join() and the ordering is no longer guaranteed by this line of code alone (see Explore 2). delay(1) marks a suspension point: it does not block the thread the way Thread.sleep would, though this teaching runner does not simulate real timing (see the caveat on Explore 4).",
