It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), compiles to native code via Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), and delivers 100% interoperability with Java.',

          'In 2010, JetBrains (the Prague-based developer tools company behind IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, and Android Studio) hit a major productivity wall with Java. Java was rock-solid and mature, but required staggering amounts of repetitive boilerplate code. Modern language features like type inference, lambdas, and null-safety were either absent or clumsy.',
          'JetBrains surveyed existing JVM alternatives like Scala and Groovy, but found Scala\'s compilation times too slow and Groovy lacked the strict compile-time type safety required for massive enterprise codebases. So in 2011, they unveiled Project Kotlin — named after Kotlin Island near Saint Petersburg.',
