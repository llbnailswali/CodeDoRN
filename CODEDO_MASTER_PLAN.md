# CodeDo Master Curriculum & Learning Framework Plan

> **Curriculum Scope Document**
> This file defines CodeDo's curriculum scope and progression. `LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md` is authoritative for lesson quality, activity selection, counts, evidence, and acceptance.

## Required Authoring Rule — Analyze Coverage Before Choosing Counts

Follow [LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md](LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md), the single
source for lesson quality, coverage planning, stage acceptance and audit gates.
It supersedes older quality guidance and activity quotas in this plan. No lesson
is a quality benchmark for another. The curriculum scope remains in this file.

---

## Curriculum Goal

Use the Kotlin roadmap from roadmap.sh as the coverage reference, but organize CodeDo around learner progression:

> **Beginner → Intermediate → Experienced**

The curriculum should feel like a coherent learning journey rather than a collection of Kotlin keywords.

**Specialization tracks are intentionally excluded for now.** The current CodeDo Kotlin curriculum focuses entirely on mastering **Core Kotlin**.

---

# 🎯 CodeDo Activity Framework

CodeDo offers six activity types. Select the activities that the lesson's
coverage map needs; their order below is a common learning path, not a
mandatory sequence or completion checklist.

```text
┌──────────────────────┐
│ 1. LEARN             │
│ Understand concept   │
└──────────┬───────────┘
           ↓
┌──────────────────────┐
│ 2. EXPLORE           │
│ Distinct examples    │

           ↓
┌──────────────────────┐
│ 6. MASTERED          │
│ Demonstrated mastery │
└──────────────────────┘
```

## The six stages

| Step | Purpose | Learner skill |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Learn** | Explain the concept clearly | Understand |
| **2. Explore** | Show distinct coverage-driven examples | Recognize |
| **3. Predict Output** | Ask independent code-reasoning questions where applicable | Reason |
| **4. Write & Run** | Ask the learner to write and execute code | Create |
| **5. Debug Program** | Give broken programs to diagnose and fix | Diagnose |
| **6. Mastered** | Confirm the learner can apply the concept | Demonstrate |

### Important principle

The stage-selection and mastery rules are defined by
[LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md](LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md). A non-executable
orientation lesson may omit editor stages with a recorded reason; a practical
lesson needs only the stages that meaningfully assess its mapped skills.

---

# 🐞 Step 5 — Debug the Program

Debugging is a core part of CodeDo, not an additional quiz.

The learner has already learned the concept, observed correct examples, predicted behavior, and written a working program. Now they must learn to deal with **incorrect code**.

The learning progression becomes:

> **Understand → Recognize → Reason → Create → Diagnose → Demonstrate**

## Types of bugs

Debugging challenges should progressively cover:

### 1. Syntax Bugs

Example:

```kotlin
val name = "Nishu
println(name)
```

Task:

> Find and fix the syntax error.

### 2. Logic Bugs

Example:

```kotlin
fun isAdult(age: Int): Boolean {
    return age < 18
}
```

The program runs, but the logic is incorrect.

This is especially valuable because real-world bugs are often logical rather than syntactical.

### 3. Runtime Bugs

Example:

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(10, 20, 30)

println(numbers[3])
```

Task:

> Identify why the program crashes and fix it.

### 4. Null-Safety Bugs

Example:

```kotlin
val name: String? = null

println(name.length)
```

Task:

> Fix the nullable access safely.

### 5. Type Bugs

Example:

```kotlin
val age = "25"

println(age + 5)
```

### 6. Collection Bugs

Example:

```kotlin
val numbers = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)

for (number in numbers) {
    if (number % 2 == 0) {
        numbers.remove(number)
    }
}
```

The learner must reason about the behavior instead of simply looking for a syntax error.

### 7. Coroutine / Flow Bugs

At Experienced level, debugging should include:

- Incorrect coroutine scope
- Missing `await()`
- Incorrect dispatcher
- Cancellation problems
- Race conditions
- Incorrect Flow operators
- StateFlow / SharedFlow mistakes
- Exception propagation problems

---

# 🧠 Debugging Hint System

Do not immediately reveal the bug.

Use progressive hints.

### Hint 1

Give a conceptual clue.

> 💡 Something is wrong with the condition.

### Hint 2

Narrow the reasoning.

> 💡 What should happen when `age` is 18?

### Final Hint

Identify the relevant concept without directly solving everything.

> 🔎 Check the comparison operator.

This keeps debugging a **problem-solving exercise** instead of turning it into another answer-recall activity.

---

# 📈 Debugging Difficulty

Debugging should become harder as the learner progresses.

| Difficulty | Challenge |
|---|---|
| 🟢 Easy | Obvious syntax error |
| 🟢 Easy | Single-line logic error |
| 🟡 Medium | Multiple possible causes |
| 🟡 Medium | Runtime + logic interaction |
| 🔴 Hard | Subtle Kotlin behavior |
| 🔴 Expert | Coroutine / Flow / concurrency bug |

Later, CodeDo can introduce timed debugging challenges such as:

> 🐞 **Bug Hunter — Find the bug before time runs out.**

---

Do not turn every node from the roadmap into a separate lesson. Group related concepts into meaningful learning units.

---

# 🧪 Recommended Content Pattern Per Topic

A typical CodeDo topic should look like this:

## Example: Null Safety

### 1. Learn
Explain:
- What nullable types are
- Why Kotlin has null safety
- `String` vs `String?`
- `?.`
- `?:`
- `!!`

### 2. Explore — Coverage-Driven Examples

Show progressively more realistic examples:

1. Basic nullable variable
2. Safe call
3. Elvis operator
4. Nullable function parameter
5. Nullable collection value
6. Combining multiple null-safe operations

### 3. Predict Output — Coverage-Driven Challenges

Show code and ask:

> **What will this program print?**

The learner must predict before seeing the answer.

### 4. Write & Run

Give a programming task:

> Write a function that safely extracts a user's display name and returns `"Guest"` when the name is missing.

The learner writes and runs the program.

### 5. Debug Program

Give broken programs such as:

```kotlin
fun getName(name: String?): Int {
    return name.length
}
```

The learner must:

1. Inspect the code
2. Identify the problem
3. Fix it
4. Run it
5. Verify the result

### 6. Mastered

Only after completing the required stages should the topic be marked:

> 🏆 **Mastered**

---

# 🎯 Final CodeDo Learning Philosophy

CodeDo should teach programming as a skill, not as information.

The six-step system is designed around six developer abilities:

| CodeDo Stage | Developer Ability |
|---|---|
| **Learn** | Understand a concept |
| **Explore** | Recognize how it is used |
| **Predict** | Reason about code |
| **Write & Run** | Create working code |
| **Debug** | Diagnose broken code |
| **Mastered** | Demonstrate independent understanding |

The core loop is:

> **Learn → Observe → Reason → Create → Repair → Master**

That should be the consistent learning model throughout the entire Core Kotlin curriculum.

---

# Reference

Kotlin roadmap used as the initial coverage reference:

https://roadmap.sh/pdfs/roadmaps/kotlin.pdf


---

# 🌐 Language-Agnostic CodeDo Learning Framework

The CodeDo curriculum architecture should **not be Kotlin-specific**.

Kotlin is the first implementation of a broader learning system that can later support additional programming languages such as:

- Java
- Python
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- C
- C++
- C#
- Go
- Rust
- Swift
- SQL
- Other languages as CodeDo expands

The **curriculum content changes by language**, but the **learning framework remains the same**.

## Core Product Principle

> **CodeDo should be a programming-learning platform, not a Kotlin-learning app.**

Kotlin is simply the first language whose curriculum is being built using the framework.

---

# 🧩 Adaptive Topic Mastery

The six learning activities are **available tools**, not mandatory steps.

Do **not** force every topic through every activity.

Instead:

> **Choose the activities that best prove understanding of that particular topic.**

The learner ultimately reaches:

> 🏆 **Mastered**

when they demonstrate sufficient understanding through the activities appropriate for that topic.

## Available Learning Activities

1. 📖 **Learn**
2. 🔍 **Explore Examples**
3. 🧠 **Predict Output / Behavior**
4. 💻 **Write & Run**
5. 🐞 **Debug the Program**
6. ❓ **Check Understanding**

**Mastered** is the outcome, not necessarily another activity.

---

# 📚 Topic Types

Each topic should have a classification that determines which activities are appropriate.

## 📖 Conceptual

Used for topics where understanding information is more important than writing code.

Examples:

- What is Kotlin?
- History of Kotlin
- What is a compiler?
- What is an interpreter?
- What is an IDE?
- Programming paradigms
- What is object-oriented programming?
- What is functional programming?

Typical flow:

```text
Learn
  ↓
Explore / Visual Explanation
  ↓
MCQ / Check Understanding
  ↓
Mastered
```

No artificial Predict, Write & Run, or Debug stages should be created.

---

## 💻 Practical

Used when the learner needs to understand and use a language feature.

Examples:

- Variables
- Conditions
- Loops
- Functions
- Collections
- Null safety
- Classes

Typical flow:

```text
Learn
  ↓
Explore
  ↓
Predict
  ↓
Write & Run
  ↓
Debug
  ↓
Check Understanding
  ↓
Mastered
```

---

## 🧠 Reasoning

Used when understanding how code behaves is especially important.

Examples:

- Operator precedence
- Scope
- Evaluation order
- Closures
- Recursion
- Collection transformations

Typical flow:

```text
Learn
  ↓
Explore
  ↓
Predict
  ↓
Check Understanding
  ↓
Mastered
```

Write & Run and Debug can be added when they provide meaningful value.

---

## 🛠️ Applied

Used for concepts that are best demonstrated through implementation.

Examples:

- Extension functions
- Generics
- APIs
- File handling
- Database operations
- Networking
- Coroutines
- Concurrency

Typical flow:

```text
Learn
  ↓
Explore
  ↓
Write & Run
  ↓
Debug
  ↓
Mastered
```

Predict and MCQ can be added when appropriate.

---

# 🧠 Adaptive Activity Selection

The curriculum engine should eventually be able to determine the appropriate activity set from topic metadata.

Example:

```text
Topic
├── title
├── language
├── level
├── category
├── type
├── concepts[]
├── activities[]
└── masteryCriteria
```

Example:

```text
"What is Kotlin?"

type = CONCEPTUAL

activities:
  - learn
  - mcq
```

```text
"Variables"

type = PRACTICAL

activities:
  - learn
  - explore
  - predict
  - write_run
  - debug
  - mcq
```

```text
"Null Safety"

type = PRACTICAL

activities:
  - learn
  - explore
  - predict
  - write_run
  - debug
  - mcq
```

```text
"Recursion"

type = REASONING

activities:
  - learn
  - explore
  - predict
  - write_run
  - debug
```

This allows the same architecture to work for every programming language.

---

# ❓ Check Understanding

MCQs should not be treated as merely a traditional quiz.

They should be used to determine whether the learner actually grasped the concept.

Questions can test:

### Recall

> Which keyword declares an immutable variable?

### Understanding

> Why would you choose an immutable value here?

### Code comprehension

> What does this code do?

### Scenario-based reasoning

> Which approach is safer in this situation?

### Error identification

> Which statement contains the problem?

### Concept comparison

> What is the difference between X and Y?

The question format can evolve beyond traditional multiple-choice into:

- Multiple choice
- Multiple select
- True / false
- Match the concepts
- Arrange in correct order
- Identify the incorrect statement
- Predict behavior
- Choose the best solution

---

# 🐞 Debugging as a Universal Programming Skill

Debugging should remain language-agnostic at the product level.

Every language can have different bug types, but CodeDo can use the same conceptual categories:

- Syntax errors
- Type errors
- Logic errors
- Runtime errors
- State-related bugs
- API misuse
- Performance problems
- Concurrency problems

The actual challenges are language-specific.

For example:

```text
Kotlin → Kotlin debugging challenge
Python → Python debugging challenge
Java → Java debugging challenge
JavaScript → JavaScript debugging challenge
```

But the learner experience remains consistent.

---

# 🎮 Generic CodeDo Architecture

The app should eventually be structured around:

```text
CodeDo
│
├── Programming Languages
│
│   ├── Kotlin
│   │   ├── Beginner
│   │   ├── Intermediate
│   │   └── Experienced
│   │
│   ├── Python
│   │   ├── Beginner
│   │   ├── Intermediate
│   │   └── Experienced
│   │
│   ├── Java
│   │   ├── Beginner
│   │   ├── Intermediate
│   │   └── Experienced
│   │
│   └── ...
│
└── Shared Learning Engine
    ├── Learn
    ├── Explore
    ├── Predict
    ├── Write & Run
    ├── Debug
    ├── Check Understanding
    └── Mastery Engine
```

The **Shared Learning Engine** should be common across languages.

Only the curriculum and language-specific execution/content need to change.

---

# 🏗️ Separate Content From Learning Engine

This is an important architectural principle.

Do not build the app around Kotlin-specific screens or Kotlin-specific assumptions.

Instead:

```text
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │  CodeDo App Engine  │
                    └──────────┬──────────┘
                               │
              ┌────────────────┴────────────────┐
              │                                 │
       Learning Engine                    Code Execution
              │                                 │
       ┌──────┴──────┐                  ┌───────┴────────┐
       │             │                  │                │
     Learn        Mastery            Kotlin           Python
       │             │                  Java          JavaScript
    Explore       Progress             C++              ...
    Predict       XP/Levels
    Write
    Debug
    MCQ
```

This means adding a new language later should primarily involve adding:

1. Curriculum
2. Examples
3. Questions
4. Coding challenges
5. Debugging challenges
6. Language execution support
7. Language-specific metadata

The core learning experience remains unchanged.

---

# 🗺️ Language Curriculum Structure

Every language should use the same high-level progression:

```text
LANGUAGE
│
├── 🟢 Beginner
│
├── 🟡 Intermediate
│
└── 🔴 Experienced
```

However, the actual worlds and topics should be language-specific.

For example:

```text
Kotlin
├── Beginner
│   ├── Kotlin Fundamentals
│   ├── Control Flow
│   ├── Functions
│   └── ...
│
Python
├── Beginner
│   ├── Python Fundamentals
│   ├── Control Flow
│   ├── Functions
│   └── ...
```

Do not assume that every language requires exactly the same topics or world structure.

The **framework is standardized; the curriculum is customized.**

---

# 🎯 Mastery Should Be Competency-Based

A topic should not become mastered simply because the learner clicked through all screens.

Mastery should be based on evidence.

For example:

```text
Conceptual Topic
→ Learn + MCQ performance

Practical Topic
→ Learn + coding performance + debugging

Reasoning Topic
→ Predict + reasoning questions

Applied Topic
→ Implementation + debugging
```

The mastery engine can eventually consider:

- Accuracy
- Number of attempts
- Hint usage
- Time taken
- Code execution results
- Test cases passed
- Debugging success
- Repeated performance

This allows CodeDo to distinguish:

> **"I completed the lesson"**

from:

> **"I actually understand this."**

---

# 📊 Generic Content Model

A future language-independent topic could conceptually be represented as:

```json
{
  "language": "kotlin",
  "level": "beginner",
  "title": "Variables",
  "type": "practical",
  "activities": [
    "learn",
    "explore",
    "predict",
    "write_run",
    "debug",
    "mcq"
  ],
  "masteryCriteria": {
    "minimumAccuracy": 80,
    "codingRequired": true,
    "debuggingRequired": true
  }
}
```

A conceptual topic:

```json
{
  "language": "kotlin",
  "level": "beginner",
  "title": "What is Kotlin?",
  "type": "conceptual",
  "activities": [
    "learn",
    "mcq"
  ],
  "masteryCriteria": {
    "minimumAccuracy": 80,
    "codingRequired": false,
    "debuggingRequired": false
  }
}
```

The same schema can represent:

```text
language = kotlin
language = python
language = java
language = javascript
language = cpp
language = rust
...
```

---

# 🚀 Product Vision

CodeDo should eventually become:

> **One app where a learner can master multiple programming languages through the same proven learning system.**

The learner shouldn't need to learn a new interaction model when switching languages.

For example:

```text
Master Kotlin
      ↓
Start Python
      ↓
Same CodeDo learning experience
      ↓
Learn → Explore → Predict → Write → Debug → Master
```

Only the **content, syntax, challenges, and execution environment** change.

---


---

# ✅ Product Decisions — Consolidated Requirements

The following decisions are mandatory principles for the current CodeDo learning system:

### Prompt 1 — Not Every Topic Uses Every Activity
Every topic **must not** automatically receive Predict Output, Write & Run, and Debug.

Examples:

```text
What is Kotlin?
→ Learn → MCQ → Mastered
```

```text
Variables
→ Learn → Explore → Predict → Write & Run → Debug → MCQ → Mastered
```

The activity set depends on what can meaningfully demonstrate understanding.

### Prompt 2 — The Plan Must Be Language-Agnostic
Kotlin is the first curriculum, not the definition of the product.

The same CodeDo learning engine should later support languages such as:

- Kotlin
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- C
- C++
- C#
- Go
- Rust
- Swift
- SQL
- Future languages

The **learning framework is shared**, while curriculum, syntax, examples, challenges, debugging content, and execution support are language-specific.

### Prompt 3 — Explore and Predict Are Not Fixed at 5–6
Never use a rule such as:

> "Every topic has 5–6 examples and 5–6 predictions."

Instead:

> **The number of exercises is determined by the amount and complexity of knowledge that needs to be practiced.**

For Predict specifically:

> **Every meaningful code behavior/detail that can be tested through prediction should be exercised adequately.**

A complex topic can therefore have 10, 15, 20, or more prediction challenges when required. A simple topic may need fewer when its coverage map demonstrates that the relevant behavior is adequately taught and assessed.

### Prompt 4 — Evidence, Not Minimums

Do not use a numerical baseline to decide whether a topic has enough practice.
Use the concept-level coverage map required by
[LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md](LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md): each activity must
cover a distinct common behavior, variation, boundary, or misconception.

Then:

```text
Actual Exercise Count
+
Learner Performance
+
Adaptive Practice
=
Personalized Mastery Path
```


# ⭐ Final Learning Philosophy

CodeDo's fundamental learning philosophy is:

> **Don't force every concept into the same lesson format. Use the right activity to prove understanding.**

The six core activities are:

> 📖 Learn  
> 🔍 Explore  
> 🧠 Predict  
> 💻 Write & Run  
> 🐞 Debug  
> ❓ Check Understanding

But the learner journey is **adaptive**.

A simple conceptual topic may only need:

> **Learn → MCQ → Mastered**

A practical programming topic may need:

> **Learn → Explore → Predict → Write & Run → Debug → Mastered**

An applied topic may need:

> **Learn → Explore → Write & Run → Debug → Mastered**

This keeps CodeDo educationally honest, avoids artificial exercises, and creates a framework that can scale from **Kotlin today to many programming languages tomorrow**.

---

# Reference

Initial Kotlin coverage reference:

https://roadmap.sh/pdfs/roadmaps/kotlin.pdf


---

# 📏 Exercise Count Strategy

The number of activities is determined by the lesson's prerequisite and
concept coverage map. There is no count formula, minimum, or maximum. Add an
activity only when it supplies distinct evidence that a mapped behavior is
taught or assessed.

---

## 🧠 Concept Coverage Determines the Actual Count

The key question should not be:

> "How many examples/questions does this topic have?"

Instead:

> **"Have we covered all important concepts, behaviors, variations, and meaningful edge cases of this topic?"**

Counts are finalized after the map is reviewed, and revised when new gaps
emerge. A short topic may need a small number of activities; a complex topic
may need many. Neither number alone establishes quality.

---

# 🔍 Explore Examples — Coverage Driven

Examples must be distinct and sufficient to build a complete mental model for
the mapped common behaviors and variations.

Examples should progressively cover:

1. Basic usage
2. Common variations
3. Different contexts
4. Edge cases
5. Real-world usage
6. Interaction with related concepts
7. Common mistakes where useful

### Example: `println()`

A simple topic may need only the examples required to establish its relevant
behaviors. For example:

```kotlin
println("Hello")
println(10)
println("Age: $age")
```

### Example: `when`

A broader topic might need:

```text
8–12 examples
```

Potential coverage:

- Basic `when`
- Multiple conditions
- `else`
- Multiple values
- Ranges
- `when` as an expression
- Type checks
- Nullable values
- Exhaustiveness
- More complex conditions

The exact count is determined by coverage, not by a fixed quota.

---

# 🧠 Predict Output / Behavior — Coverage Driven

Prediction exercises should cover the important behaviors of the topic with
independent reasoning scenarios.

The goal is:

> **The learner should exercise every important detail that can meaningfully be tested by predicting code behavior.**

### Example: `when`

Possible coverage:

```text
Basic branch          → 1+
Multiple conditions   → 1+
else                  → 1+
Multiple values       → 1+
Ranges                → 1+
Expression result     → 1+
Type checking         → 1+
Nullable values       → 1+
Exhaustiveness        → 1+
Edge cases            → 1+
```

This could result in 10–15 prediction challenges.

---

# 🎯 Predict Should Test Understanding, Not Counting

Do not define success as:

```text
6 predictions completed
        ↓
Topic complete
```

Instead:

```text
Topic
 ↓
Identify important behaviors
 ↓
Create prediction challenges
 ↓
Track concept coverage
 ↓
Evaluate accuracy
 ↓
Mastery
```

For example:

```text
Null Safety

Knowledge Points
✓ Nullable types
✓ Safe calls
✓ Elvis operator
✓ !!
✓ Null checks
✓ Smart casts
✓ Nullable collections

Prediction Coverage: 100%
Prediction Accuracy: 88%

🏆 Ready for Mastery
```

The number of questions is secondary to whether the learner has exercised the important concepts.

---

# 🔄 Adaptive Expansion

The mapped core activities establish the baseline. Adaptive practice adds
targeted activities only when learner evidence shows a specific gap.

CodeDo can eventually support adaptive expansion based on learner performance.

Example:

```text
Null Safety
     ↓
Core predictions: 8
     ↓
Learner struggles with `?.`
     ↓
+ 3 targeted `?.` exercises
     ↓
Learner improves
     ↓
Continue
```

Another learner might perform strongly:

```text
Null Safety
     ↓
Core predictions: 8
     ↓
Strong performance
     ↓
No additional exercises
     ↓
Continue
```

This allows CodeDo to eventually personalize practice without changing the underlying curriculum.

---

# ❗ Activity Selection Must Fit the Topic

Activities must not be forced onto topics where they do not meaningfully
assess the mapped outcome.

For example:

## What is Kotlin?

```text
Learn
  ↓
Appropriate comprehension checks
  ↓
Mastered
```

No artificial:

- Predict Output
- Write & Run
- Debug

activities should be created.

## Variables

```text
Learn
  ↓
Coverage-driven Explore
  ↓
Coverage-driven Predict
  ↓
Write & Run
  ↓
Debug
  ↓
MCQ
  ↓
Mastered
```

## A highly conceptual topic

```text
Learn
  ↓
Explore / Visual Explanation
  ↓
Appropriate comprehension checks
  ↓
Mastered
```

---

# 🧩 Final Activity Selection Rule

For every topic:

```text
1. Identify the topic type
2. Identify its knowledge points
3. Select applicable activities
4. Derive activities from the concept-level coverage map
5. Add or revise activities until meaningful concept coverage is achieved
6. Evaluate learner performance
7. Add adaptive exercises when useful
8. Mark the topic Mastered when mastery criteria are satisfied
```

This creates a system that is:

- **Consistent** — every activity has a documented coverage purpose
- **Flexible** — complex topics can have as many activities as coverage needs
- **Efficient** — simple topics are not padded unnecessarily
- **Comprehensive** — important details are not skipped
- **Adaptive** — struggling learners can receive targeted practice
- **Language-agnostic** — the same strategy works for Kotlin, Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, Rust, SQL, and future languages

---

# ⭐ Updated CodeDo Principle

> **Coverage determines depth. Learner performance determines additional practice.**

This should replace any fixed rule such as:

> "Every topic must have 5–6 examples and 5–6 prediction questions."

The correct product rule is:

> **Every applicable topic has the distinct examples and assessments its coverage map requires.**


---


---

# 🔗 Curriculum-to-World Alignment Rule

This is a critical content-quality rule for CodeDo.

> **Every topic introduced in the detailed curriculum must be explicitly assigned to a World.**

The master topic taxonomy and the World structure must never drift apart.

For example, if the detailed curriculum says Kotlin Fundamentals includes:

- What is Kotlin?
- Kotlin syntax
- `main()`
- Comments
- `print()` / `println()`
- `val` vs `var`
- Variables
- Type inference
- `Int`
- `Long`
- `Float`
- `Double`
- `Boolean`
- `Char`
- `String`
- String templates

then **World 1 — Kotlin Awakening must explicitly contain all of them**.

Likewise, if Operators contains:

- Arithmetic operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Assignment operators
- Increment / decrement
- Operator precedence

then **World 2 — Operator Forge must explicitly contain all of them**.

### Curriculum Integrity Check

### Write & Run Task Authoring Standard — Required

Every runnable Write & Run lesson must use the same learner-facing task
structure as World 2 — Arithmetic Operators. Do not use a generic one-line
prompt or a generic `// TODO` in the editor.

1. The task description must state the setup, then list numbered implementation
   steps separated by blank lines, followed by the exact expected output when
   applicable.
2. `initialCode` must preserve useful starter declarations and contain the
   same numbered `//` comments at the exact locations where the learner writes
   each step. Leave a blank writable line after every comment.
3. Every description step and editor comment must name the actual operation,
   variable, or output being authored — never only “write the transformation.”
4. The solution, expected output, and Debug exercise must validate the same
   stated task.

A lesson is not complete merely because it executes; its task guidance and
starter editor must also meet this standard.

Before finalizing or releasing a curriculum:

1. Extract every topic from the detailed taxonomy.
2. Find its assigned World.
3. Confirm it appears explicitly in the World's topic list.
4. Confirm no important topic exists only in the taxonomy and nowhere in the Worlds.
5. Confirm no World contains vague labels that hide multiple unlisted concepts.
6. Confirm every topic has an appropriate activity strategy.
7. Confirm exercise counts are coverage-driven rather than fixed.
8. Confirm the concept coverage map justifies activity counts and carries supported concepts into Write & Run and Debug, with any gaps explicitly recorded.
9. Confirm the World Boss tests integration of the World concepts.

This creates a **single source of truth relationship**:

```text
Detailed Curriculum
       ↓
Knowledge Points
       ↓
World Assignment
       ↓
Topic Activities
       ↓
Exercises
       ↓
Mastery Evidence
       ↓
World Boss
```

A curriculum is not considered complete until this chain is traceable.

# 🧭 Master Strategy — Adaptive, Topic-Aware & Language-Agnostic Learning

This section consolidates the product decisions for CodeDo's learning system.

## 1. The Learning Framework Is Flexible

CodeDo has a set of learning activities:

1. 📖 **Learn**
2. 🔍 **Explore Examples**
3. 🧠 **Predict Output / Behavior**
4. 💻 **Write & Run**
5. 🐞 **Debug the Program**
6. ❓ **Check Understanding / MCQ**
7. 🏆 **Mastered** — the outcome

These are **not mandatory steps that every topic must contain**.

The correct principle is:

> **Use the activities that meaningfully prove understanding of the topic.**

Do not force coding activities onto purely theoretical topics.

### Example — "What is Kotlin?"

A learner does not need to write a program or debug code to demonstrate basic understanding of the introduction to Kotlin.

```text
Learn
  ↓
Explore / Explanation
  ↓
MCQ / Check Understanding
  ↓
Mastered
```

### Example — "Variables"

Variables are practical, so a fuller experience is appropriate:

```text
Learn
  ↓
Explore
  ↓
Predict
  ↓
Write & Run
  ↓
Debug
  ↓
MCQ / Check Understanding
  ↓
Mastered
```

### Example — "Recursion"

Recursion requires both behavioral reasoning and implementation:

```text
Learn
  ↓
Explore
  ↓
Predict
  ↓
Write & Run
  ↓
Debug
  ↓
Mastered
```

The exact activity combination is determined by the topic.

---

# 2. Topic Classification

Every topic should be classified so CodeDo can determine which activities make sense.

## 📖 Conceptual

Primarily theoretical or foundational.

Examples:

- What is Kotlin?
- Introduction to Kotlin
- History of Kotlin
- What is a compiler?
- What is an interpreter?
- Programming paradigms
- What is object-oriented programming?

Typical activities:

```text
Learn
Explore / Visual Explanation
MCQ
```

Do not manufacture Predict, Write & Run, or Debug challenges.

---

## 💻 Practical

A topic where the learner needs to use a programming feature.

Examples:

- Variables
- Operators
- Conditions
- Loops
- Functions
- Collections
- Null Safety
- Classes

Typical activities:

```text
Learn
Explore
Predict
Write & Run
Debug
MCQ
```

---

## 🧠 Reasoning

A topic where understanding program behavior is particularly important.

Examples:

- Operator precedence
- Evaluation order
- Scope
- Closures
- Recursion
- Collection transformations

Typical activities:

```text
Learn
Explore
Predict
MCQ
```

Write & Run and Debug are added when they provide meaningful value.

---

## 🛠️ Applied

A topic whose understanding is best demonstrated through implementation.

Examples:

- Extension functions
- Generics
- File handling
- Networking
- APIs
- Coroutines
- Concurrency

Typical activities:

```text
Learn
Explore
Write & Run
Debug
```

Predict and MCQ are optional based on the topic.

---

# 3. No Fixed Maximum for Explore or Predict

CodeDo should **not** use a universal rule such as:

> "Every topic must have 5–6 examples."

or:

> "Every topic must have 5–6 prediction questions."

That creates two problems:

### Problem A — Simple topics become padded

For a tiny topic such as `println()`, six examples may be unnecessary.

### Problem B — Complex topics become artificially shallow

A topic such as `when`, Null Safety, Collections, Coroutines, or Flow may contain many distinct behaviors. Stopping at six exercises could leave important concepts untested.

Therefore:

> **The number of exercises must be determined by topic complexity and concept coverage.**

---

# 4–5. Activity Counts and Coverage

See [LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md](LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md). The former
minimum-count table and MAX formula are retired. Record coverage and derive
counts before authoring; no numeric quota applies.

---

# 6. Explore Is Coverage-Driven

The purpose of Explore is to build the learner's mental model.

Examples should cover meaningful aspects such as:

- Basic usage
- Common variations
- Different contexts
- Edge cases
- Real-world usage
- Interaction with related concepts
- Common mistakes
- Increasing complexity

### Example — `println()`

Potentially:

```text
3 examples
```

because the concept is simple.

### Example — `when`

Potentially:

```text
8–12 examples
```

because the topic may cover:

- Basic `when`
- Multiple branches
- `else`
- Multiple values
- Ranges
- `when` as an expression
- Type checks
- Nullable values
- Exhaustiveness
- More complex conditions

The count should be whatever is required to create a complete understanding.

---

# 7. Predict Output / Behavior Is Also Coverage-Driven

Predict should not be treated as:

> "Answer six questions and move on."

Instead:

> **Exercise every important detail of the topic that can meaningfully be tested through code behavior.**

For each topic, identify its important behaviors and create prediction challenges around them.

### Example — Null Safety

Possible knowledge points:

```text
1. Nullable types
2. Safe calls ?.
3. Elvis operator ?:
4. Non-null assertion !!
5. Null checks
6. Smart casts
7. Nullable collections
```

Prediction coverage might therefore look like:

```text
Nullable types       → 2
Safe calls           → 2
Elvis operator       → 2
!!                   → 1
Null checks          → 2
Smart casts          → 2
Nullable collections → 2

Total = 13
```

The exact distribution is not fixed.

The important requirement is:

> **Every meaningful behavior that can be tested through prediction should receive adequate practice.**

---

# 8. Prediction Should Cover Depth, Not Just Breadth

A single prediction question should not be considered sufficient merely because a concept appeared once.

For important or error-prone behaviors, CodeDo can use multiple variations.

For example:

```text
Topic: Elvis operator

Prediction 1 → Basic nullable value
Prediction 2 → Non-null value
Prediction 3 → Null value
Prediction 4 → Function returning nullable
Prediction 5 → Nested expression
```

This allows the learner to encounter the behavior in different contexts.

---

# 9. Adaptive Expansion

In the future, exercise counts can also respond to learner performance.

Start with a core set:

```text
Core Prediction Set
        ↓
Evaluate performance
        ↓
Strong understanding?
   /             \
 YES             NO
 ↓                ↓
Continue       Add targeted exercises
```

For example:

```text
Null Safety
Core predictions: 8
        ↓
Learner repeatedly misses `?.`
        ↓
Add 3 targeted `?.` predictions
        ↓
Re-evaluate
```

Another learner may demonstrate strong understanding and need no additional exercises.

This creates:

> **Mapped core coverage + adaptive practice**

---

# 10. Mastery Is an Outcome, Not a Fixed Screen Sequence

Do not define mastery as:

```text
Complete 6 questions
        ↓
Mastered
```

Instead:

```text
Identify topic
      ↓
Identify knowledge points
      ↓
Select applicable activities
      ↓
Review the coverage map
      ↓
Achieve sufficient concept coverage
      ↓
Evaluate learner performance
      ↓
Add targeted practice if necessary
      ↓
🏆 Mastered
```

This means a learner has demonstrated competency rather than simply completed a predetermined number of screens.

---

# 11. Language-Agnostic Product Architecture

This strategy must remain **generic and independent of Kotlin**.

Kotlin is the first language implementation, not the definition of the CodeDo product.

The same learning engine should eventually support:

- Kotlin
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- C
- C++
- C#
- Go
- Rust
- Swift
- SQL
- Other future languages

The learning framework remains the same while the curriculum and language-specific content change.

---

# 12. Shared Learning Engine

The future CodeDo architecture should look conceptually like:

```text
                         CodeDo
                           │
                  ┌────────┴────────┐
                  │                 │
           Learning Engine     Language Engine
                  │                 │
       ┌──────────┼──────────┐      ├── Kotlin
       │          │          │      ├── Python
     Learn     Practice   Mastery   ├── Java
     Explore   Evaluate   Progress  ├── JavaScript
     Predict   Adapt      XP        ├── C++
     Write     Debug               └── ...
     MCQ
```

The **Learning Engine** is shared.

The **language-specific content and execution layer** changes per language.

---

# 13. Language-Independent Topic Schema

A topic should conceptually contain:

```text
Topic
├── language
├── level
├── category
├── type
├── knowledgePoints[]
├── activities[]
├── examples[]
├── predictionChallenges[]
├── codingChallenges[]
├── debuggingChallenges[]
├── mcqQuestions[]
└── masteryCriteria
```

For example:

```json
{
  "language": "kotlin",
  "level": "beginner",
  "title": "Variables",
  "type": "practical",
  "knowledgePoints": [
    "val",
    "var",
    "type inference",
    "basic types"
  ],
  "activities": [
    "learn",
    "explore",
    "predict",
    "write_run",
    "debug",
    "mcq"
  ]
}
```

A conceptual topic could be:

```json
{
  "language": "kotlin",
  "level": "beginner",
  "title": "What is Kotlin?",
  "type": "conceptual",
  "activities": [
    "learn",
    "mcq"
  ]
}
```

The same schema can represent:

```text
language = kotlin
language = python
language = java
language = javascript
language = cpp
language = rust
...
```

---

# 14. Generic Language Progression

Every language can use the same broad progression:

```text
LANGUAGE
│
├── 🟢 Beginner
│
├── 🟡 Intermediate
│
└── 🔴 Experienced
```

However, the actual worlds and topics should remain language-specific.

Do not assume every programming language has exactly the same concepts or requires exactly the same number of worlds.

The principle is:

> **Standardize the learning framework, not the curriculum content.**

---

# 15. Final CodeDo Learning Philosophy

CodeDo should teach programming as a skill rather than as information.

The product should optimize for:

> **Understanding → Reasoning → Creation → Debugging → Demonstrated Mastery**

The available activities are:

> 📖 Learn  
> 🔍 Explore  
> 🧠 Predict  
> 💻 Write & Run  
> 🐞 Debug  
> ❓ Check Understanding

But the learner journey is **adaptive**.

A simple conceptual topic may be:

```text
Learn → MCQ → Mastered
```

A practical topic may be:

```text
Learn → Explore → Predict → Write & Run → Debug → Mastered
```

A reasoning topic may be:

```text
Learn → Explore → Predict → MCQ → Mastered
```

An applied topic may be:

```text
Learn → Explore → Write & Run → Debug → Mastered
```

Explore and Predict counts must be derived separately from the concept-level
coverage map, with no numeric quota.

### The final product rule

> **Concept coverage determines depth. Learner performance determines additional practice. The learning framework stays consistent across programming languages.**
