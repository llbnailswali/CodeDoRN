# CodeDo Curriculum Data Gathering & Question Authoring Progress

**Status:** Active — reflects the real, currently-shipped content against `CODEDO_MASTER_PLAN.md`'s actual 22-world structure.

This file has two sections that must not be conflated:

1. **Five-Stage Content Progress** — the real lesson format (`Learn → Explore → Predict → Write&Run → Debug → Mastered`) that the app actually runs, tracked against `MASTER_PLAN.md`'s real world names/numbers. This is the number that matters for "is World N actually done."
2. **Legacy Question Bank Inventory** — an older, different format (`LessonQuestion[]`, flat MCQ/bug-fix/output-prediction banks) authored before `MASTER_PLAN.md`'s 22-world structure existed. Its world numbers/topics do **not** match `MASTER_PLAN.md`'s current numbering (e.g. the old "World 9" bank is about Jetpack Compose; `MASTER_PLAN.md`'s real World 9 is "Lambda Lab"). This content is not wasted — it's real, validated Kotlin questions — but it must be **remapped** to whichever `MASTER_PLAN.md` world actually covers that topic before it counts as progress on that world. Do not read a legacy bank's existence as "World N is done."

## Quality verification (separate from content inventory)

Authority: [LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md](LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md). A registered
lesson or an auto-generated “Complete” row below does not mean quality-verified.
World 1: **Changes required**, with capability blockers; first-pass evidence and
repair queue are in [WORLD_1_CONTENT_REVIEW.md](WORLD_1_CONTENT_REVIEW.md).
Worlds 2–6: first-pass audits are recorded in their `WORLD_N_CONTENT_REVIEW.md`
files; see each review for status and remaining work.
World 7: **Audit in progress** — all 11 lessons reviewed, engine/content fixes
and execution evidence in [WORLD_7_CONTENT_REVIEW.md](WORLD_7_CONTENT_REVIEW.md).
Browser QA and hardcode-resistance checks remain open; this is not Verified.
World 9: **Audit in progress** — all 12 lessons re-audited; coverage, practice
and engine repairs are in [WORLD_9_CONTENT_REVIEW.md](WORLD_9_CONTENT_REVIEW.md).
Browser QA and assessment hardening remain open.
World 10: **Audit in progress** — all runnable lesson activities have exact
execution evidence and the collection runner was repaired; browser QA,
hardcode-resistance assessment, and optional real-Kotlin comparison remain
open. See [WORLD_10_CONTENT_REVIEW.md](WORLD_10_CONTENT_REVIEW.md).
World 11: **Changes required** — 14 lessons are authored, while the runner now
has exact evidence for inheritance, interfaces, data classes/enums, object
declarations, and the Boss. Companion objects, nested/inner classes, extension
properties, delegation, delegated properties, and visibility diagnostics remain
engine work. See [WORLD_11_CONTENT_REVIEW.md](WORLD_11_CONTENT_REVIEW.md).
World 12: **Verified** — all 15 lessons. See
[WORLD_12_CONTENT_REVIEW.md](WORLD_12_CONTENT_REVIEW.md).
World 13: **Verified** for execution/coverage correctness — all 10 lessons,
after this session built the engine's first `let`/`run`/`apply`/`also`/`with`
support from zero and fixed a real array-hole content bug and a stale-starter
Write & Run task. See [WORLD_13_CONTENT_REVIEW.md](WORLD_13_CONTENT_REVIEW.md).
A later pass also found and fixed the card/question-level content this world
needed under [LESSON_CLARITY_STANDARD.md](LESSON_CLARITY_STANDARD.md), but
that world's own stage-level `explore.subtitle`/`predict.subtitle` were later
found reused across 9 of 10 lessons and are NOT yet fixed — see that
standard's per-world status table (World 13 is "Partial" there, not "Passed").
World 14: **Verified** for execution/coverage correctness — all 13 lessons,
after this session built the engine's first `Sequence`/`sequenceOf`/
`generateSequence`/`.asSequence()` lazy-evaluation support from zero (real JS
generators, genuine element-by-element evaluation order, single-use-vs-
reusable semantics matching real Kotlin) and fixed two previously-invisible
pre-existing engine bugs it surfaced (a JS automatic-semicolon-insertion
hazard, and `KotlinList` silently comparing as unequal via reference identity
instead of structural equality). See
[WORLD_14_CONTENT_REVIEW.md](WORLD_14_CONTENT_REVIEW.md). This world has NOT
had a [LESSON_CLARITY_STANDARD.md](LESSON_CLARITY_STANDARD.md) pass at all —
deferred deliberately to the later, batch clarity audit across every world.
World 15: **Verified** for execution/coverage correctness — all 15 lessons,
after this session built the engine's first real exception hierarchy
(`Throwable`/`Exception`/`RuntimeException`/`IllegalStateException`/
`IllegalArgumentException`/`NumberFormatException`/etc., matching real
Kotlin's subtype relationships), typed multi-catch dispatch, try/catch as
an expression, expression-position `throw` (Elvis/if-branch), `Result`/
`runCatching`, `require`/`check`/`error`, a throwing `String.toInt()`
(previously silently lenient), and a real compile-time "class is final by
default" check — plus fixed a genuine array-hole data-corruption bug (30
literal `},,` double-commas silently dropping cards/questions from
iteration) and several undefined-helper-function content bugs. See
[WORLD_15_CONTENT_REVIEW.md](WORLD_15_CONTENT_REVIEW.md). This world has
NOT had a [LESSON_CLARITY_STANDARD.md](LESSON_CLARITY_STANDARD.md) pass at
all — deferred deliberately to the later, batch clarity audit across every
world.
Worlds 16–17 are authored in `masterCurriculumCatalog.ts` (synced in the same
way World 12/13/14/15 arrived) but have **no content-review file and no
execution-correctness audit at all** — treat as Not audited, not as any
lesser degree of "done," until each gets the same engine-capability check and
lesson-by-lesson review World 13/14/15 just received. World 16 (Coroutine
Academy) and World 17 (Flow Universe) in particular almost certainly need
real async/coroutine engine support this simulator has never had, before any
of their content can be trusted to run.
Later worlds are not certified under this standard by this audit. Earlier reviews
remain useful evidence but do not automatically establish acceptance.

## 1. Five-Stage Content Progress (source of truth for actual completion)

Format: `src/data/lessonStagesData.ts` (shared lessons) + `src/data/curriculum/world1LessonsData.ts` (World 1's own lessons), registered in `AVAILABLE_FIVE_STAGE_LESSONS` and linked from `masterCurriculumCatalog.ts` via `fiveStageLessonKey`.

**This table is auto-generated — do not hand-edit it.** Run
`npm run update-progress` (or `node scripts/update-data-gathering-progress.mjs`)
to regenerate it from the actual state of `masterCurriculumCatalog.ts`. Edit
everything else in this file by hand as normal; only the block between the
markers below is overwritten.

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED:FIVE-STAGE-PROGRESS:START -->

| World (per `MASTER_PLAN.md`) | Five-stage lessons authored | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| World 1 — Kotlin Awakening | 13 / 13 | ✅ Complete |
| World 2 — Operator Forge | 7 / 7 | ✅ Complete |
| World 3 — Decision Maker | 9 / 9 | ✅ Complete |
| World 4 — Loop Master | 11 / 11 | ✅ Complete |

| World 21 — Performance Lab | 0 / 15 | ⬜ Not started |
| World 22 — Production Kotlin | 0 / 22 | ⬜ Not started |

**17 of 22 worlds complete by the format that actually ships.** Everything else in `masterCurriculumCatalog.ts` beyond the complete worlds is placeholder metadata (`questionsCount: 0`, no `fiveStageLessonKey`) — this is expected and self-documented in that file, not a bug.

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED:FIVE-STAGE-PROGRESS:END -->

(Run the script above to fill in the real, current numbers for every world
— the two rows shown here are just placeholders until the first run.)

## 2. Legacy Question Bank Inventory (old format — needs remapping, not yet counted above)

Format: `LessonQuestion[]` in `src/data/curriculum/world{N}_*.ts`, aggregated via `src/data/curriculum/index.ts`'s `ALL_CURRICULUM_QUESTIONS`. This is the **old, pre-`MASTER_PLAN` 16-world catalog** (`index.ts`'s `WORLDS_CATALOG`) — its world numbers are a separate, conflicting scheme from `MASTER_PLAN.md` and must not be read as "world N progress."

| Old-catalog world # | File | Topic (old catalog's own label) | Lessons | Questions | Which real `MASTER_PLAN.md` topic this likely maps to |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `world1_foundations.ts` | Kotlin Foundations | 8 | 40 | World 1 (already superseded by the real five-stage World 1 above — this file's content is redundant now, not a gap) |
| 2 | `world2_logic.ts` | Logic & Branches | 5 + Boss | 26 | World 3 — Decision Maker |
| 3 | `world3_loops.ts` | Loops | 5 + Boss | 26 | World 4 — Loop Master |
| 4 | `world4_functions.ts` | Functions | 7 + Boss | 36 | World 5 — Function Forge |
| 5 | `world5_oop.ts` | Classes & OOP | 6 + Boss | 31 | World 8 — Object Kingdom |
| 6 | `world6_collections.ts` | Collections & Functional Kotlin | 6 + Boss | 31 | World 6 — Collection Valley (and/or World 10 — Collection Wizardry for the functional-operations half) |
| 7 | `world7_generics.ts` | Generics & Advanced Type System | 5 + Boss | 26 | World 12 — Generic Realm |
| 8 | `world8_coroutines.ts` | Coroutines & Async Kotlin | 5 + Boss | 26 | World 16 — Coroutine Academy |
| 9 | `world9_compose.ts` | Android & Jetpack Compose | 5 + Boss | 26 | Not yet a `MASTER_PLAN.md` world (Compose/Android isn't in the current 22-world Core-Kotlin-only scope) |
| 10 | `world10_architecture.ts` | Real-World Architecture & Clean Code | 5 + Boss | 26 | Not yet a `MASTER_PLAN.md` world |
| — | `dailyBattleBank.ts` | Daily Battle question pool | — | 10 | Cross-cutting, not world-specific |

**Total legacy bank: ~294 curriculum questions + 10 Daily Battle questions across the old 10-world scheme.** This is genuinely valuable, previously-validated content — the actual data-gathering work for Worlds 2+ should draw on it as raw material, remapped per the right-hand column above, rather than writing every question from scratch.

The "topic → real world" mapping above is a first-pass guess based on topic overlap, not a confirmed plan — confirm against `MASTER_PLAN.md`'s actual per-world topic list before remapping any specific question.

---

## 3. Known data-quality caveats when remapping (see `PITFALLS.md` for full detail)

- Any Debug exercise relying on a type distinction (`Int`/`Long`, `Float`/`Double`, `Boolean`/`Char` vs `String`) needs re-verification — the simulator (`kotlinRunner.ts`) has no real type system and this class of bug has already caused silent auto-pass exercises 4 times.
- Any code containing single-quote Char literals, numeric literals with `_`/type suffixes, or triple-quoted strings renders correctly now (fixed this cycle), but re-verify visually after remapping into a new lesson, since these were previously silently corrupted.
- Run `npm run audit:output-quotes` after authoring any `writeRun`/`debug` content — it catches whitespace mismatches between description/TODO/solution/expectedOutput automatically.

---

## 4. Next action

All 22 worlds' `masterCurriculumCatalog.ts` slots through World 17 are
authored (Worlds 18-22 are the real gap: `0/N` each). But authored is not
audited: the next execution-correctness audit target is
**World 16 — Coroutine Academy**, the earliest authored-but-never-reviewed
world remaining (World 15 was just completed this session; Worlds 16-17
arrived the same way World 12/13/14/15 did, via a sync commit, with no
`WORLD_N_CONTENT_REVIEW.md` and no engine-capability check at all). Follow
the exact process World 13/14/15 just went through: check whether the
topic's core operations even parse/execute in
`kotlinRunner.ts`/`kotlinFunctions.ts` (for World 16, coroutines/`suspend`/
`launch`/`async`/`await`/dispatchers/structured concurrency -- check
whether any of this exists at all before assuming it does; a browser-based
teaching simulator has no real thread pool, so a "coroutine" here will
likely need to be modeled as something JS-native like a Promise/generator
rather than genuine concurrency), build only what's missing, then run
every lesson's actual Learn/Explore/Predict/Write&Run/Debug content through
`compileAndRunKotlin` before trusting any of it. World 16 (Coroutine
Academy) and World 17 (Flow Universe) should both be expected to need
substantial new engine work (coroutines/Flow have never been touched),
likely the largest remaining engine effort in the beginner-through-
intermediate curriculum.

Separately, a full [LESSON_CLARITY_STANDARD.md](LESSON_CLARITY_STANDARD.md)
pass (readability/confusion/dash-collision/generic-subtitle) is queued for
ALL worlds (1-14 so far, growing) as its own later, batch effort -- not
folded into each world's execution-correctness audit going forward, per
explicit direction. Track that separately in that standard's own per-world
status table, not here.

In parallel, close the non-engine acceptance work already identified:

- World 10: browser visual QA, hardcode-resistance assessment, and optional
  real-Kotlin comparison.
- World 11: per-activity capability classification, remaining OOP engine work,
  browser QA, and hardcode-resistance review for existing Write/Debug tasks.
- World 13: browser visual QA and a real-Kotlin-compiler comparison (not
  performed this session; see WORLD_13_CONTENT_REVIEW.md).

Use [LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md](LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md), not the master
plan, for activity selection, counts, stage acceptance, and audit status. Do
not declare a world quality-verified solely because its authored inventory is
complete.

## 5. Resume protocol (start of every content-authoring session)

(Salvaged from the now-retired `CODEDO_DATA_GATHERING.md`.)

1. Read this file (`data_gathering_progress.md`) in full.
2. Read `CODEDO_MASTER_PLAN.md` for the world/topic you're about to author.
3. Read `PITFALLS.md` (auto-loaded already via `CLAUDE.md`) — check for anything relevant to what you're about to write.
4. Inspect the actual current state of `src/data/curriculum/` — don't trust this file blindly if it looks stale; verify against the code.
5. Identify the first incomplete world/lesson from Section 1 above.
6. Continue from that exact location — never assume work starts from World 1.
7. After authoring: run `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run audit:output-quotes`, and
   actually execute every new `writeRun.solutionCode`/`debug.brokenCode`/
   `debug.fixedCode` through `compileAndRunKotlin` (a small Node/tsx harness
   importing the lesson data directly) diffed against `expectedOutput` —
   see PITFALLS.md's "Int / Int division never truncated" entry for why
   reading the data alone isn't enough.
8. Run `npm run update-progress` to regenerate Section 1's table from the actual state of `masterCurriculumCatalog.ts` — never hand-edit that table, the script derives it from real code so it can't drift stale again.
9. Append a session log entry below.

## 6. Session log

Append one entry per meaningful session, most recent first.

## 2026-09-21 (World 15 quality audit, VERIFIED for execution correctness)

World/Lesson: World 15 — Error Fortress, execution-correctness audit of all
15 lessons (Exceptions & try, Catch, finally, throw, Multiple catch blocks,
Try as an expression, Custom exceptions, Checked vs unchecked exception
model, Result, runCatching, Success/failure handling, Error handling
patterns, Avoiding swallowed errors, Designing meaningful failure paths,
Boss).

What/Why: World 15's whole topic (exceptions) had ZERO real engine support
before this session -- no exception class hierarchy, no typed multi-catch
dispatch (a single untyped catch only, and a second consecutive catch was
a hard parse error), no try/catch as an expression, no expression-position
`throw`, no `Result`/`runCatching`, no `require`/`check`, and a lenient
(never-throwing) `String.toInt()`. Built, in order: a real
Throwable/Exception/RuntimeException/IllegalStateException/
IllegalArgumentException/NumberFormatException/etc. hierarchy (new file
`src/utils/kotlinExceptions.ts`, matching real Kotlin's subtype
relationships); Result<T> + runCatching (standalone and receiver forms); a
full try/catch/finally rewrite in `kotlinFunctions.ts` (typed
instanceof-chain dispatch, statement vs. expression-position rendering
decided from the real preceding token, a real-control-flow no-IIFE path
for the tail-of-block case mirroring the existing if-expression
precedent); expression-position `throw` via a `__kt_throw` helper (Elvis
RHS and if-expression branches); a throwing `String.toInt()` with the
exact JVM error message format; `require`/`check`/`error`; and a genuine
compile-time "class is final by default" check
(`checkFinalClassInheritance`) that a `bugType: 'type'` debug exercise
depended on and the engine had never modeled at all. Two boundary-
detection helpers (`expressionEnd`/`statements` in kotlinFunctions.ts)
needed `catch`/`finally` added to their newline-triggers-a-split exclusion
lists to support a multi-line `try {...}` \n `catch (...) {...}` shape
common in this world's Predict content. Also fixed a genuine, previously-
undetected data-corruption bug: 30 literal `},,` double-commas across
`world15LessonsData.ts` silently created sparse-array holes (inflating
`.length` while `.map()`/iteration skipped the hole entirely -- caught by
the audit's own `assert.ok(card, ...)` hole check, not by reading the
data), plus 9 Explore/Predict snippets referencing an undefined helper
function (`risky()`/`useDefault()`/`load()`), each fixed with a minimal,
type-matching throwing definition.

Evidence: `npm run test:world15-content` (new script, 227 checks: every
Explore card, every Predict question -- including real call-graph
reachability analysis to correctly distinguish "this snippet is expected
to crash/propagate/fail-to-compile" from an actual runner regression --
every Write & Run solution/starter pair, every Debug fixed/broken pair).
Full cross-world regression, zero failures: test:lambda-runner (80),
test:collection-runner (31+5+20), test:world11-content (56),
test:world12-runner (6), test:world13-content (158), test:world14-content
(197), audit:output-quotes (49 blocks), audit:dash-collision (0 findings),
tsc --noEmit, npm run build.

Content/catalog fixes: stale questionsCount across all 15 catalog rows
(same recurring pattern as every other synced world); the 30-instance
`},,` array-hole bug; 9 undefined-helper-function snippets.

Full detail: WORLD_15_CONTENT_REVIEW.md. New PITFALLS.md entry: "World 15
(Error Fortress): building a real exception hierarchy, try/catch dispatch,
and expression-position `throw` from zero" (covers the final-class-
inheritance type-bug generalization and the array-hole-comma pitfall).

Next: World 16 (Coroutine Academy) is the next execution-correctness audit
target -- expect this and World 17 (Flow Universe) to need the largest
remaining engine effort so far, since neither coroutines nor Flow have
ever been touched, and this is a browser-based simulator with no real
thread pool to model true concurrency against.

## 2026-09-21 (World 14 quality audit, VERIFIED for execution correctness)

World/Lesson: World 14 — Sequence Dimension, execution-correctness audit of
all 13 lessons (What sequences are, Eager collection processing, Lazy
processing, Creating sequences, asSequence(), Intermediate operations,
Terminal operations, Sequence evaluation order, Short-circuiting,
Sequences vs collections, Performance trade-offs, When sequences should
and should not be used, and the Boss). Content had already been authored
via a prior sync commit with zero engine support and zero audit; unlike
most prior synced worlds, every card/question was already pre-labeled
verified-by-real-kotlin / conceptual-real-kotlin-required /
deferred-by-capability by whoever authored it.
Completed:
- Confirmed via compileAndRunKotlin that Sequence/sequenceOf/
  generateSequence/.asSequence() had zero support at all before this
  session.
- Built a real, generator-backed KotlinSequence class from scratch
  (kotlinCollections.ts): genuine element-by-element lazy evaluation
  (verified against the lesson's own expected interleaved println
  traces, not just final values), single-use-vs-reusable semantics
  matching real Kotlin exactly (no-seed generateSequence and a bare
  Iterator.asSequence() throw on a second traversal), a sequence{}
  builder via a new protect-and-restore pass for yield/yieldAll,
  standalone range values (1..100) as a new capability, and
  is Sequence<Int>/is List<Int> support.
- Added .take()/.drop()/.takeWhile()/.dropWhile() to KotlinList itself
  (eager) alongside the lazy KotlinSequence versions, and
  .takeIf/.takeUnless to Object.prototype (World 13-style).
Found and fixed (engine, pre-existing, not new-feature gaps): a JS
automatic-semicolon-insertion hazard (bare literal declaration + a
following statement starting with "(" got misparsed as calling the
literal as a function), and KotlinList had no real .equals(), so == on
two structurally-identical-but-distinct Lists silently returned false
via reference-equality fallback. See PITFALLS.md for both.
Found and fixed (content/catalog): stale questionsCount across all 13
catalog rows, and a genuine id-truncation bug (catalog id, catalog
fiveStageLessonKey, and lessonStagesData.ts's registration key were all
truncated to "...should-and-should-not-be-" while the lesson's own
internal id field was the full, untruncated string).
Verification:
- New scripts/test-world14-content.ts (npm run test:world14-content):
  197 checks, 0 failures.
- Zero regressions: npm run test:lambda-runner (80), test:collection-runner
  (31+5+20), test:world11-content (56), test:world12-runner (6),
  test:world13-content (158), audit:output-quotes (49 blocks),
  audit:dash-collision (0 findings), npx tsc --noEmit, npm run build.
Explicitly deferred: LESSON_CLARITY_STANDARD.md's readability/confusion/
dash-collision/generic-subtitle checks were NOT performed for this world
-- per explicit direction, queued for a later batch pass across every
world instead of folding into each world's own execution-correctness
audit going forward.
Gaps found: Worlds 15-17 remain authored-but-unaudited, same situation
World 13/14 were in before their own passes -- World 15 (Error Fortress)
flagged as the next execution-correctness audit target in Section 4.

## 2026-09-21 (World 13 quality audit, VERIFIED)

World/Lesson: World 13 — Scope Masters, quality audit of all 10 lessons
(let & run, apply, also, with, this vs it, Return values of scope
functions, Choosing the appropriate scope function, Scope-function
chaining, Avoiding overuse and nesting, and the Boss). Content had already
been authored via a prior sync commit with zero engine support and zero
audit.
Completed:
- Confirmed via `compileAndRunKotlin` that NONE of let/run/apply/also/with
  worked at all before this session -- every one failed with either
  "X.let is not a function" or a hard parse error.
- Built full engine support for all five in kotlinFunctions.ts/
  kotlinRunner.ts, verified with a 16-case scratch harness before trusting
  any lesson content, then re-verified against the actual lesson data.
- Added StringBuilder (zero prior support) and a general fix for a bare
  Int literal immediately followed by `.member` (`4.also{...}`, a real JS
  SyntaxError otherwise).
Found and fixed (content, not engine):
- A real array-hole bug (`[..., , {...}]`) in the let & run lesson's
  Explore/Predict arrays, silently making one card/question `undefined`.
- A Write & Run starter (Avoiding overuse and nesting) that already
  produced the expected output before any edit -- rewrote to the standard
  TODO()-based starter shape.
- An Explore card and Debug pair relying on unsupported labeled receivers
  (`this@outer`) -- rewritten to use a named local variable instead,
  preserving the same teaching point.
- Stale `questionsCount` (all still `4`) across all 10 World 13 catalog
  rows in masterCurriculumCatalog.ts.
Found (engine, serious, not scope-function-specific): a class's primary
constructor parameter with a default value (`class Box(var n: Int = 0)`)
was silently registering that name as a real ROOT-SCOPE variable
everywhere later in the file -- completely invisible until World 13's new
bare-receiver-member-write rule started checking "does this name already
exist in scope," which is exactly what tripped over it. Fixed with a new
constructorParamTokens exclusion set. See PITFALLS.md for the full story
and WORLD_13_CONTENT_REVIEW.md for the complete audit.
Verification:
- New `scripts/test-world13-content.ts` (`npm run test:world13-content`):
  158 checks, 0 failures -- every Explore card, every Predict question,
  every Write & Run solution/starter pair, every Debug fixed/broken pair.
- Zero regressions: npm run test:lambda-runner (80), test:collection-runner
  (31+5+20), test:world11-content (56), test:world12-runner (6),
  audit:output-quotes (49 blocks), npx tsc --noEmit, npm run build.
- Not performed: browser visual QA, real-Kotlin-compiler comparison.
Gaps found: Worlds 14-17 are authored in the catalog but have zero
content-review files and zero audits, same situation World 13 was in
before this session -- flagged as the next audit target in Section 4.

## 2026-09-18 (World 9, COMPLETE)

World/Lesson: World 9 — Lambda Lab, all 12 lessons: Lambda Expressions,
Anonymous Functions, Function Types, Higher-Order Functions, it, Function
References, Returning from Lambdas, Local Returns, Inline Functions,
noinline, crossinline, and the Functional Utility Engine boss.
Completed:
- Authored all 12 topics as real five-stage content in
  src/data/curriculum/world9LessonsData.ts, registered every lesson in
  AVAILABLE_FIVE_STAGE_LESSONS, and replaced all World 9 catalog placeholders
  with real descriptions, question counts, and fiveStageLessonKey values.
- The eight runtime-safe topics use Learn, Explore, Predict, Write & Run,
  Debug, and Mastered. The four compiler-semantic topics (local returns,
  inline, noinline, and crossinline) use Learn, Predict, and Mastered only;
  they deliberately do not offer misleading JS-simulator coding exercises.
Added:
- Phase 1 function-as-value runner support in kotlinRunner.ts: typed and
  implicit-`it` single-expression lambdas, function-type annotations,
  higher-order calls including trailing-lambda syntax, ::function references,
  and anonymous functions with local returns. The supported scope is explicit:
  no labelled/non-local returns or compiler-only inline behavior.
- scripts/test-lambda-runner.ts plus npm run test:lambda-runner, covering five
  representative callable-value programs.
Verification:
- Executed 64 World 9 runnable solution/debug/predict/Explore snippets through
  compileAndRunKotlin: 0 failures. Every fixed debug program matched its
  expected output; every broken program executed and produced a distinct
  result where applicable.
- npm run audit:output-quotes passed (49 blocks), npx tsc --noEmit passed,
  npm run build passed, and the existing Stage 4 editor/curriculum regression
  suite passed all 150 checks.

## 2026-09-16 (World 8, COMPLETE)

World/Lesson: World 8 — Object Kingdom, all 14 lessons: Classes, Objects,
Properties, Methods, Constructors, Primary Constructors, init, Visibility
Modifiers, Data Classes, Enums, Basic Inheritance, Interfaces, Overriding
Members, and the World Boss (Student Grade Manager).
Completed:
- Authored all 14 topics as real five-stage content in the new
  src/data/curriculum/world8LessonsData.ts, registered each in
  AVAILABLE_FIVE_STAGE_LESSONS, and gave each masterCurriculumCatalog.ts
  entry a real description/questionsCount/fiveStageLessonKey (all were
  placeholders).
- Visibility Modifiers used the Reasoning topic-type pattern (Learn ->
  Explore -> Predict -> Mastered, no Write & Run/Debug) since real access-
  control ENFORCEMENT is a compile-time-only concept this engine has no
  way to check (a private property is just a plain, fully-accessible JS
  property once transpiled) -- grading a "private access should fail" bug
  would be exactly the silent-auto-pass trap this file warns about
  repeatedly. Every other lesson used the full six stages.
- World 8 — Object Kingdom is now 14/14, COMPLETE (8/22 overall).
Added:
- The single largest kotlinRunner.ts engine addition to date: a whole-
  source OOP pre-pass (`transpileOOPDeclarations`, run before every other
  transform) adding real support for `class`/`data class`/`enum class`/
  `interface`/`object`, primary constructors (val/var shorthand and plain
  parameters), `init` blocks (including multiple, running in written
  order), methods, property overrides, `open`/`override` inheritance with
  `extends`+`super()`, and interface implementation (distinguished from
  class extension by the presence/absence of constructor-call parens after
  the supertype name). Kotlin's no-`new`-keyword instantiation is handled
  by collecting every declared class name and inserting `new` before its
  call sites in one final pass.
- Three real bugs caught only by executing generated JS, not by reading
  the transform code: (1) trailing blank lines from body-splitting made a
  single-line member look multi-line, so single-expression methods and
  property initializers were misclassified and left untranspiled -- fixed
  by trimming trailing blank lines in `transpileClassMember`. (2) a data
  class's generated `toString()` used a template literal with the class
  name directly adjacent to `(`, which the later `new`-insertion pass then
  corrupted (since it has no notion of "inside a string literal") --
  fixed by building the string via concatenation instead, so the class
  name is never immediately followed by a literal `(` in the source text.
  (3) the `extends` clause was being added whenever ANY supertype was
  named, without checking whether it was a real class (parens) or an
  interface (no parens) -- fixed to gate `extends`/`super()` on the
  presence of constructor-call parens specifically.
- One scope decision adopted (not a bug, a documented convention): method
  bodies must reference a class's own properties via explicit
  `this.propertyName`, never a bare identifier. Bare-name property access
  would require real lexical scope resolution to avoid corrupting a method
  parameter that happens to share a property's name (e.g.
  `fun setName(name: String) { name = name }`), which this line-based
  transpiler can't safely do. All World 8 lesson content was authored
  consistently with this convention.
- A `data class`'s `toString()` needed the class name genuinely absent
  from the `new`-insertion regex's blast radius (see bug #2 above);
  verified by printing a data class instance both directly and inside a
  string concatenation.
Reused (from legacy bank):
- world5_oop.ts was noted as the likely source for World 8 remapping in
  Section 2, but was not read this session -- all content was authored
  fresh against the newly-built engine subset, following the same
  from-scratch-content pattern as Worlds 4, 6, and 7.
Verification:
- 109 checks across every lesson's writeRun.solutionCode, debug.brokenCode/
  fixedCode pairs, every executable predict snippet, AND every Explore
  card's code (not just writeRun/debug/predict, extended this session
  since Explore cards are illustrative but still worth confirming they
  actually run) were executed through compileAndRunKotlin by importing
  world8LessonsData.ts directly -- 0 failures, and every debug pair
  confirmed to produce genuinely different broken-vs-fixed output.
- A full regression sweep re-ran Worlds 2-8's existing writeRun/debug
  content after the OOP engine changes (World 1 skipped due to a pre-
  existing circular-import quirk between world1LessonsData.ts and
  lessonStagesData.ts when imported directly outside Vite -- confirmed
  unrelated to this session by testing World-1-style constructs inline
  instead, and via npm run build, which resolves the real circular import
  fine) -- 0 regressions across 130 checks.
- npm run audit:output-quotes passed (49 blocks -- this world's content
  mostly concatenates variables/expressions into println rather than bare
  string literals, so little of it was newly flagged). npx tsc --noEmit
  shows only the same three pre-existing ErrorBoundary.tsx errors. npm run
  build succeeds.
Gaps found:
- None new. The pre-existing orphaned-lesson bug (`functions-lesson`,
  `loops-lesson`) remains unfixed and out of scope, flagged again here
  only for continuity.
Scope limitations documented in PITFALLS.md for future OOP-adjacent
content (World 11 — OOP Evolution will need to respect these too):
- Method/member headers must be single-line (no wrapping before `{`).
- No chained/nested classes, no secondary constructors, no multiple
  supertypes (single inheritance/interface at a time).
- Enum bodies support only a plain constant list -- no extra members,
  `.values()`, or `.ordinal`.
- Interfaces with a DEFAULT method body (not just abstract signatures) are
  silently dropped -- interface declarations are deleted wholesale at
  transpile time.

## 2026-09-16 (World 7, COMPLETE)

World/Lesson: World 7 — Null Safety Shield, all 11 lessons: Nullable Types,
Nullable Variables, Safe Call ?., Elvis Operator ?:, Non-null Assertion !!,
Null Checks, Smart Casts, Safe Casts as?, Nullable Collections & Collection
Values, Chaining Nullable Operations, and the World Boss (Safe Data
Processor).
Completed:
- Authored all 11 topics as real five-stage content in the new
  src/data/curriculum/world7LessonsData.ts, registered each in
  AVAILABLE_FIVE_STAGE_LESSONS, and gave each masterCurriculumCatalog.ts
  entry a real description/questionsCount/fiveStageLessonKey (all were
  placeholders).
- World 7 — Null Safety Shield is now 11/11, COMPLETE (7/22 overall).
Added:
- This world needed the single largest kotlinRunner.ts engine expansion
  since the project started, since it had ZERO prior support for any
  null-safety syntax. New support, in the order it was built:
  - Nullable type annotations (`String?`, `List<Int?>`, `Map<String, Int?>`)
    -- widened the val/var (and fun-signature) type-stripping regexes to
    accept `?`, and separately to accept `,`/whitespace for multi-param
    generics like `Map<K, V>` (the first version only handled single-
    parameter generics and silently failed to transpile a Map-typed
    declaration at all -- caught by the harness, not by reading the regex).
  - `?.` needs NO new transform -- it's already valid JS optional chaining
    with matching null-propagation semantics.
  - `?:` (Elvis) -- straight `?:` -> `??` (JS nullish coalescing is
    semantically equivalent for this simulator's null/undefined model).
  - `!!` (non-null assertion) -- a new `__kt_notNull()` runtime helper that
    throws a real error (surfacing as `result.success: false`, exactly like
    Kotlin's own NullPointerException) when the asserted value actually is
    null/undefined. Deliberately scoped to ONE `!!` per line (non-global
    regex) -- chaining two independent `!!` assertions on the same line is
    NOT supported and documented as an explicit scope limit, since a naive
    global match mis-binds the second assertion to the wrong sub-expression
    (verified this failure mode before choosing the single-match design).
  - `as? Type` (safe cast) -- reuses the same Int/Long/Float/Double/String/
    Boolean typeof-map `is`/`!is` already used, deliberately excluding Char
    for the same reason documented elsewhere in PITFALLS.md. Plain
    (unsafe) `as` remains unsupported -- not in this world's topic list.
  - `formatKotlinValue` now treats JS `undefined` the same as `null` when
    printing -- needed because a `?.` chain that short-circuits produces
    `undefined` in JS, not `null`, and Kotlin has only one null to begin
    with.
  - A nullable collection reference's safe-call size (`list?.size`) needed
    its own transform, `($1 == null ? null : __kt_size($1))`, since the
    existing `.size` -> `__kt_size(...)` regex doesn't match across the
    `?` and, more importantly, `__kt_size` itself would throw on a null
    receiver rather than safely producing null.
  - Destructured Map iteration (`for ((key, value) in map)`) was already
    added during World 6 and reused directly here for the Boss and the
    Chaining/Nullable-Collections lessons -- no changes needed.
- All additions verified with dedicated scratch harnesses (15 cases for
  the core operators, 9 more for nullable-collection access, plus a 9-case
  full regression sweep across Worlds 1-7) before any lesson content was
  authored against them, confirming zero regressions.
Reused (from legacy bank):
- Not applicable this session -- World 7 has no corresponding legacy-bank
  entry in Section 2 (the old catalog's null-safety coverage, if any, was
  folded elsewhere); all content authored fresh against the newly-built
  engine subset.
Verification:
- Every one of the 11 lessons' writeRun.solutionCode and debug.brokenCode/
  fixedCode pairs (22 checks total) were executed through the real
  compileAndRunKotlin by importing world7LessonsData.ts directly in a
  scratch harness, confirming fixedCode matches expectedOutput exactly AND
  that brokenCode produces genuinely different output (including several
  brokenCode cases that correctly crash outright -- e.g. calling `!!` on an
  actual null, or `.length` on a null String with no safe call -- verified
  as loud, real errors rather than silent wrong answers).
- All 33 executable predict-question code snippets across the world were
  also run through the same engine and diffed against each question's
  marked-correct option.
- npm run audit:output-quotes passed (49 blocks checked -- this world's
  content mostly concatenates variables into println rather than using
  bare literal arguments, so little of it was newly flagged by this
  whitespace-specific audit; still ran it to confirm no regressions).
  npx tsc --noEmit shows only the same three pre-existing
  ErrorBoundary.tsx errors, unrelated to this session. npm run build
  succeeds.
Gaps found:
- None new. The pre-existing orphaned-lesson bug (`functions-lesson`,
  `loops-lesson`) noted in earlier sessions remains unfixed and out of
  scope, flagged again here only for continuity.

## 2026-09-16 (World 6, COMPLETE)

World/Lesson: World 6 — Collection Valley, remaining 7 lessons (5 through 11 of 11):
Mutable vs Read-Only Collections, Creating and Accessing Collections,
Adding/Removing/Updating Mutable Elements, Iterating Over Collections,
Basic Collection Operations, Choosing the Right Collection Type, and the
World Boss (Student Records).
Completed:
- Authored all 7 remaining topics as real five-stage content in
  src/data/curriculum/world6LessonsData.ts, registered each in
  AVAILABLE_FIVE_STAGE_LESSONS, and gave each masterCurriculumCatalog.ts
  entry a real description/questionsCount/fiveStageLessonKey (all were
  placeholders).
- "Choosing the Right Collection Type" deliberately used the Reasoning
  topic-type pattern from CODEDO_MASTER_PLAN.md (Learn -> Explore ->
  Predict -> Mastered, no Write & Run/Debug) since it's a comparison
  topic, not new code to write -- mirrors World 1's "What is Kotlin?"
  conceptual pattern. Every other lesson used the full six stages.
- World 6 — Collection Valley is now 11/11, COMPLETE (6/22 overall).
Added:
- Major kotlinRunner.ts engine work required before these lessons could
  run: `.isEmpty()`/`.isNotEmpty()`/`.first()`/`.last()`/`.sorted()`/
  `.get(index)` on List/Array/Set results, `.removeAt(index)` on
  mutableListOf results, and destructured Map iteration
  (`for ((key, value) in map)`) in transformForLoops. Verified with a
  12-case scratch harness before authoring any lesson content, plus every
  individual lesson's writeRun/debug/predict snippets re-verified after
  assembly.
- Deliberately did NOT add `!!`/`?:` (Null Safety, World 7) support this
  session -- discovered while first drafting the World Boss, which
  originally tried `scores[name]!!` and hit a hard parse error. Redesigned
  the Boss to use `for ((name, score) in scores)` destructuring instead
  (which returns a non-null Int directly, with no nullable ambiguity),
  avoiding the unbuilt feature entirely rather than half-supporting it.
  Flagged as the concrete first blocker for World 7 in Section 4 above.
- The World Boss (Student Records) combines a List, a Set, and a mutable
  Map with an accumulator loop, plus a debug exercise built around an
  off-by-boundary comparison (score > 40 vs >= 40) rather than a syntax
  bug, matching the "boundary is subtle, not just a typo" spirit of a
  boss-level bug.
Verification:
- All 6 remaining writeRun/debug pairs (Mutable vs Read-Only through the
  World Boss; Choosing the Right Collection Type has neither) executed
  through compileAndRunKotlin and diffed against expectedOutput, including
  confirming every debug bugType:'logic'/'runtime' pair produces genuinely
  different broken-vs-fixed output. All executable predict snippets passed
  the same way. The Mutable vs Read-Only debug/predict content
  deliberately includes a case that errors out (calling .add() on a
  read-only listOf result) -- confirmed via the harness that this is a
  real, loud runtime error in the engine (TypeError), not a silent wrong
  answer, before using it as a debug/predict scenario.
- npm run audit:output-quotes passed (49 blocks checked -- most of this
  session's new code prints concatenated expressions/variables rather than
  bare string literals, so it wasn't newly flagged by this whitespace-
  specific audit; still ran it to confirm no regressions). npx tsc
  --noEmit shows only the same three pre-existing ErrorBoundary.tsx
  errors, unrelated to this session.
Next: World 7 — Null Safety Shield. Needs new kotlinRunner.ts support for
nullable types, `?.`, `?:`, and `!!` before any content can be authored --
see Section 4 above.

## 2026-09-16 (World 6, in progress, continued)

World/Lesson: World 6 — Collection Valley, Maps (4 of 11 lessons)
Completed:
- Authored Maps as real five-stage content in
  src/data/curriculum/world6LessonsData.ts, registered it in
  AVAILABLE_FIVE_STAGE_LESSONS and gave masterCurriculumCatalog.ts's
  world-6-maps entry real description/questionsCount/fiveStageLessonKey
  (was placeholder).
- World 6 is now 4/11 in the auto-generated progress table.
Added:
- kotlinRunner.ts engine work required before Maps content could run:
  `.containsKey(...)` and `.containsValue(...)` on mapOf/mutableMapOf
  results (delegating to Map.prototype.has and a values-array .includes
  check respectively). Verified with a 9-case scratch harness (create +
  print, key lookup, containsKey true/false, size, mutable key update, and
  a genuine broken/fixed wrong-key debug pair) run through the real
  compileAndRunKotlin engine before authoring the final lesson content.
- Deliberately avoided teaching missing-key bracket access (map["missing"])
  in Predict content: the engine's Map.get returns JS undefined for an
  absent key, which formatKotlinValue renders as the string "undefined"
  rather than Kotlin's "null" for a nullable lookup miss. Used
  containsKey (which the engine handles correctly) instead of relying on
  an unverified null-formatting edge case.
Verification:
- All Maps Write & Run solution, broken/fixed Debug code, and all three
  prediction snippets pass compileAndRunKotlin exactly, including
  confirming the debug bugType:'logic' pair produces genuinely different
  output.
- npm run audit:output-quotes passed (49 blocks checked, no mismatches).
  npx tsc --noEmit shows only the same three pre-existing
  ErrorBoundary.tsx errors, unrelated to this change.
Next: Mutable vs read-only collections (world-6-mutable-vs-read-only-collections),
the 5th of 11 World 6 lessons.

## 2026-09-16 (World 6, in progress)

World/Lesson: World 6 — Collection Valley, Sets (3 of 11 lessons)
Completed:
- Authored Sets as real five-stage content in
  src/data/curriculum/world6LessonsData.ts, registered it in
  AVAILABLE_FIVE_STAGE_LESSONS and gave masterCurriculumCatalog.ts's
  world-6-sets entry real description/questionsCount/fiveStageLessonKey
  (was placeholder).
- World 6 is now 3/11 in the auto-generated progress table.
Added:
- kotlinRunner.ts engine work required before Sets content could run:
  `.contains(...)` on arrayOf/listOf/mutableListOf/setOf/mutableSetOf
  results, and `.remove(...)` on mutableSetOf results (delegating to
  Set.prototype.delete) — see new PITFALLS.md entry for detail. Verified
  with a 9-case scratch harness (dedup on creation, contains true/false,
  mutable add, duplicate-add no-op, and a genuine broken/fixed debug pair)
  run through the real compileAndRunKotlin engine before authoring the
  final lesson content, and again after assembly.
Verification:
- All Sets Write & Run solution, broken/fixed Debug code, and all three
  prediction snippets pass compileAndRunKotlin exactly, including
  confirming the debug bugType:'logic' pair produces genuinely different
  output (per the "Debug exercises must be reproducible by this app's
  simulator" pitfall).
- npm run audit:output-quotes passed (49 blocks checked, no mismatches).
  npx tsc --noEmit shows only the same three pre-existing
  ErrorBoundary.tsx errors, unrelated to this change.
Next: Maps (world-6-maps), the 4th of 11 World 6 lessons.

## 2026-09-15 (World 6, in progress)

World/Lesson: World 6 — Collection Valley, Arrays (1 of 11 lessons)
Completed:
- Authored Arrays as real five-stage content in
  src/data/curriculum/world6LessonsData.ts and registered it in
  AVAILABLE_FIVE_STAGE_LESSONS and masterCurriculumCatalog.ts.
- World 6 is now 1/11 in the auto-generated progress table.
Added:
- Narrow simulator support for arrayOf, Kotlin-style collection printing,
  List/Array size, mutable-list add/remove, setOf, mapOf `to` pairs,
  Map lookup, and mutable Map updates, verified with six representative
  Kotlin programs before Arrays content was authored.
Verification:
- Arrays Write & Run solution, broken/fixed Debug code, and all three
  prediction snippets pass compileAndRunKotlin exactly.
- npm run audit:output-quotes passed. npm run lint remains blocked by the
  same three pre-existing ErrorBoundary.tsx typing errors.

## 2026-09-15 (World 5)

World/Lesson: World 5 — Function Forge (all 9 lessons)
Completed:
- Defining functions, Function parameters, Return values, Default
  parameters, Named arguments, Single-expression functions, Local
  functions, vararg, and the World Boss (Utility Toolkit) — all six
  stages each, in src/data/curriculum/world5LessonsData.ts.
- Registered all 9 in AVAILABLE_FIVE_STAGE_LESSONS (lessonStagesData.ts)
  and gave masterCurriculumCatalog.ts's World 5 block real
  descriptions/questionsCount/fiveStageLessonKey values (was all
  placeholder metadata).
- World 5 now 9/9 in the auto-generated progress table (5/22 overall).
Added:
- Coverage-driven three-example and three-prediction sets for every
  Function Forge topic, plus a Write & Run and reproducible logic-debug
  exercise for each lesson.
- The World Boss combines return values, default parameters,
  single-expression functions, and vararg accumulation.
Reused (from legacy bank):
- world4_functions.ts informed the Kotlin facts and topic framing, while
  all final five-stage content was authored fresh against the current
  curriculum and simulator subset.
Verification:
- All 9 Write & Run solutions plus all 9 broken/fixed debug pairs were
  executed through compileAndRunKotlin. All 24 executable prediction
  snippets also passed their expected-output checks.
- The three named-argument predictions are deliberately display-only:
  named calls are valid Kotlin but explicitly unsupported in executable
  simulator content. Its Write & Run and Debug stages correctly use
  positional calls.
- Follow-up QA moved every pre-Local-Functions declaration back to
  top-level scope and made prediction choices render exact output with
  visible whitespace and preserved newlines. A full rerun passed all 51
  executable World 5 snippets.
- npm run audit:output-quotes passed. npm run lint remains blocked by
  three pre-existing ErrorBoundary.tsx typing errors (state/props missing
  on ErrorBoundary), unrelated to World 5.

## 2026-09-15 (World 4)

World/Lesson: World 4 — Loop Master (all 11 lessons)
Completed:
- for, while, do-while, Ranges, Progressions, downTo, step, break,
  continue, Nested loops, and the World Boss (Pattern & Number
  Analyzer) — all six stages each, in
  src/data/curriculum/world4LessonsData.ts.
- Registered all 11 in AVAILABLE_FIVE_STAGE_LESSONS (lessonStagesData.ts)
  and gave masterCurriculumCatalog.ts's World 4 block real
  descriptions/questionsCount/fiveStageLessonKey (was all placeholder).
- World 4 now 11/11 in the auto-generated progress table (4/22 overall).
Added:
- Major kotlinRunner.ts engine work required before any World 4 content
  could run at all: `transformForLoops`, a per-line regex transform
  that rewrites `for (i in <range>) { ... }` into a plain JS for-loop,
  supporting `a..b`, `a until b`, `a downTo b`, and any of those with a
  trailing `step n`. Deliberately does NOT support iterating a
  collection (`for (x in list)`) or a standalone range/progression
  value (`val r = 1..10`) — out of scope until a later world. Ordered
  to run BEFORE World 3's `transformTypeChecks`/`transformRanges`
  (those look for a bare `in`/`!in` and would otherwise misfire on a
  for-loop header's `in` keyword before it's rewritten). `while`,
  `do-while`, `break`, `continue`, and nested loops needed zero engine
  work — all already valid JS as-is. New PITFALLS.md-style verification:
  16 engine-level checks (range/until/downTo/step in every combination,
  while, do-while including the at-least-once guarantee, break,
  continue, nested loops) all run through the real engine before any
  content was authored, then every lesson's writeRun/debug/predict code
  re-verified the same way after assembly — zero regressions against
  World 1-3.
- Hit an agent-pool rate limit mid-batch (9 of 11 agents failed
  simultaneously with a 429). Recovered by retrying the failed lessons
  in smaller batches (3, then 3, then 1) instead of all at once — no
  content was lost, this only affected pacing.
Reused (from legacy bank):
- world3_loops.ts was noted as the likely source for World 4 remapping
  in Section 2 below, but was not actually read this session — all
  content was authored fresh against the engine-verified syntax subset
  rather than adapted from the legacy bank.
Gaps found:
- Same pre-existing orphaned-lesson bug as prior sessions
  (`functions-lesson`, `loops-lesson`) and the same latent
  `staticValidateKotlin` comment-inside-string bug — still out of
  scope, still unfixed, flagged again here for continuity.

## 2026-09-15 (World 3)

World/Lesson: World 3 — Decision Maker (all 9 lessons)
Completed:
- if, if-else, else-if, when, when with ranges, when as an expression,
  Multiple conditions and nested conditions, Type checks with is where
  appropriate, and the World Boss (Grade & Eligibility System) — all
  six stages each, in src/data/curriculum/world3LessonsData.ts.
- Registered all 9 in AVAILABLE_FIVE_STAGE_LESSONS (lessonStagesData.ts)
  and gave masterCurriculumCatalog.ts's World 3 block real
  descriptions/questionsCount/fiveStageLessonKey (was all placeholder).
- World 3 now 9/9 in the auto-generated progress table (3/22 overall).
Added:
- Major kotlinRunner.ts engine work required before any World 3 content
  could run at all: single-line if-as-expression (ternary), a whole-
  source `when` block transpiler (statement and expression form; comma-
  value branches, `in`/`!in` range branches, required subject, single-
  line branch results only), standalone `in`/`!in` range checks, and
  `is`/`!is` type checks narrowly scoped to Int/Long/Float/Double/
  String/Boolean (never Char, never inside `when`). New PITFALLS.md
  entry documents the exact supported subset and the known gap (an
  if-expression nested inside a when-branch result is unsupported).
- All 9 lessons' writeRun/debug code, plus every predict question with
  a `code` array, were executed through the real `compileAndRunKotlin`
  engine (not just hand-traced) via a scratch harness — zero failures,
  zero regressions against World 1/2's existing suite.
Reused (from legacy bank):
- world2_logic.ts's `if-else-expression` and `when-expression` lesson
  content informed the Kotlin facts and framing used (if-expression
  replaces the ternary operator, comma-value/range `when` branches),
  though all final content was authored fresh for the six-stage format.
Gaps found:
- Same pre-existing orphaned-lesson bug as last session (`functions-lesson`,
  `loops-lesson`) — still out of scope, still unfixed, flagged again here.
- New, pre-existing (not caused by this session), latent bug found while
  running World 1's predict-question code through the real engine as a
  bonus check: `staticValidateKotlin`'s per-line comment-stripping does
  `rawLine.indexOf('//')` without checking whether that `//` is actually
  inside a string literal, so a line like `println("// Not a comment")`
  is misread as having its string truncated at the `//`, producing a
  false "Unclosed string literal" error. Never affects a real user today
  since Predict-stage code is only displayed, never executed (confirmed
  by grepping Explore.tsx/Predict.tsx/Learn.tsx for compileAndRunKotlin
  -- no matches) -- but would break a future writeRun/debug exercise
  whose code contains `//` inside a string. Confirmed none of World 2/3's
  new graded code triggers it. Not fixed this session -- out of scope,
  flagged for whoever next touches `staticValidateKotlin`.

## 2026-09-15 (World 2)

World/Lesson: World 2 — Operator Forge (all 7 lessons)
Completed:
- Arithmetic operators, Comparison operators, Logical operators,
  Assignment operators, Increment/decrement, Operator precedence,
  and the World Boss (Smart Calculator) — all six stages each, in
  src/data/curriculum/world2LessonsData.ts.
- Registered all 7 in AVAILABLE_FIVE_STAGE_LESSONS (lessonStagesData.ts)
  and gave masterCurriculumCatalog.ts's World 2 block real
  descriptions/questionsCount/fiveStageLessonKey (was all placeholder).
- World 2 now 7/7 in the auto-generated progress table.
Added:
- Comparison Operators and Logical Operators expanded from the drafted
  3 explore/3 predict to 5/5 each (individual <, >, standalone !, a
  combined &&/||/! example) per explicit user direction not to stick to
  the bare minimum when a topic supports more coverage.
- New PITFALLS.md entry + kotlinRunner.ts fix: Int/Int division never
  truncated in the simulator (47 / 5 computed as 9.4, not 9) — fixed
  with a conservative static int-type inference pass + targeted
  Math.trunc() wrapping for the identifier/literal ÷ identifier/literal
  case. Found by actually executing every writeRun/debug block through
  compileAndRunKotlin rather than reading the data, which is now the
  documented standard verification step (see Section 5, step 7).
Reused (from legacy bank):
- world1_foundations.ts's "operators" lesson (division truncation,
  modulo, precedence, val-increment bug) and world2_logic.ts's
  "comparisons"/"logical-operators" lessons informed the Kotlin facts
  used, though all final content was authored fresh for the six-stage
  format and independently hand-verified rather than copied.
Gaps found:
- Two orphaned, non-MASTER_PLAN legacy lessons in lessonStagesData.ts
  ('functions-lesson', worldId 'world-4'; 'loops-lesson') have
  writeRun.solutionCode that defines a function but never calls/prints
  it, so it produces empty output against a non-empty expectedOutput.
  Pre-existing, unrelated to World 2, out of scope for this session —
  flagged here rather than fixed silently.

## 2026-09-19 — World 12 data gathering started

Completed:
- Created [WORLD_12_CONTENT_REVIEW.md](WORLD_12_CONTENT_REVIEW.md) with the
  15 catalog lessons, authoritative capacity decisions, legacy-bank inventory,
  and pre-authoring findings.
- Added generic-class erasure for declarations and explicit constructor calls.
  `npm run test:world12-runner` verifies six exact runtime cases: generic
  classes/functions, multiple parameters, aliases, APIs, and the Boss shape.

Reused (from legacy bank):
- Identified 31 generic-programming questions in `world7_generics.ts` as
  source material only. They require lesson-by-lesson remapping and runner or
  real-Kotlin verification before they count as World 12 activities.

Gaps found:
- The representative `inline reified` / `is T` probe also fails; do not author
  reified runnable activities until a narrow supported subset exists.
- Constraints, variance, projections, and star projections require
  compiler-reference evidence rather than simulator execution claims.

## 2026-09-19 — Quality tracking and World 11 runner repairs

Completed:
- Replaced the stale World 11 pre-authoring queue with the active World 11
  capability work and World 12 authoring priority.
- Recorded World 10 and World 11 quality states separately from their complete
  authored-inventory rows.
- Updated `CODEDO_MASTER_PLAN.md` so `LESSON_QUALITY_STANDARD.md` exclusively
  governs activity counts, stage selection, evidence, and acceptance.

Added:
- World 11 runner support and exact audit checks for data-class `copy()` and
  value equality, abstract inheritance, multiple interfaces, interface default
  methods, and qualified interface `super` calls.

Gaps found:
- World 11 still needs companion objects, nested/inner classes, extension
  properties, delegation, delegated properties, and visibility diagnostics.
- World 10 still needs browser QA, hardcode-resistance assessment, and optional
  real-Kotlin comparison before it can be Verified.

## 2026-09-19 — World 10 editor capacity

Collection runner audit and implementation completed for the scope in [WORLD_10_CAPACITY_AUDIT.md](WORLD_10_CAPACITY_AUDIT.md). Added 31 behavior fixtures checked against real Kotlin, 5 rejection checks and execution checks for all 20 existing writing/debug solutions. Updated the ten World 10 workbook rows with verified behavior and remaining limits. Corrected the partition lesson to use Pair.first.

Content authoring remains separate: existing repeated Explore/Predict templates have not been expanded. The audit maps required concepts to examples/predictions and writing/debugging targets; counts must follow that coverage analysis, not a fixed quota.
